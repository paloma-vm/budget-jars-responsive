# Budget Jars Responsive

Final project ACS 2330 May 2023

An app for those who want to use the jar system for budgeting and reducing debt, but don't want to have to use actual cash.  The jar system keeps track of variable spending for the time period (usually a month or a week).  This digital version of the jar system is easy to use.

To use Budget Jars, click on the Get Started link and fill out the budget sheet.  Then your Jars will be created and you can start saving!

If you get to the end of the month before you get to the end of the jars, you are on track!

## Note:
Still working on responsiveness and accessibility.
I lost the responsiveness to the levels in the jars, I tried to translate it to Tailwind, but no luck so far.
I am working on the functionality of the budget page.
I am also working on getting the jars to appear if there is a new user/nothing stored in local storage.
## TODO:
- fix tailwind for 
    - responsive levels bg color
    - compound rounded bottom edges of jar level
- use templates for Nav/Footer
- I would like to add more styling as well and make it look better.
- add progress images to README
