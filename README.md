# Budget Jars

Spring Intensive March 2023

An app for those who want to use the jar system for budgeting and reducing debt, but don't want to have to use actual cash.  The jar system keeps track of variable spending for the time period (usually a month or a week).  This digital version of the jar system is easy to use.

To use Budget Jars, click on the Get Started link and fill out the budget sheet.  Then your Jars will be created and you can start saving!

If you get to the end of the month before you get to the end of the jars, you are on track!

## Note:

I am working on the functionality of the budget page.
I am also working on getting the jars to appear if there is a new user/nothing stored in local storage.

I would like to add more styling as well and make it look better.
